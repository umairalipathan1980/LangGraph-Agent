# LangGraph Smart Question Answering Agent with Intelligent Internet Search

This is a simple LangGraph agent application that answers user's queries by deciding whether the answer should be given by a large langugae model or by real-time internet serach.  

The application creates an AI agent using Groqâ€™s free API and LangGraph, demonstrating how AI agents can combine decision-making workflows and real-time internet searches to enhance functionality.  

This application is based on my article [How to Develop a Free AI Agent with Automatic Internet Search](https://ai.gopubby.com/how-to-develop-a-free-ai-agent-with-automatic-internet-search-5ea24928d26b)
